Our initial meeting concluded with the brainstorming session for our project. Each team member proposed an idea, and we voted to reach a final decision. Our objective was to create an app or website that simplifies everyday tasks. We considered several design directions, such as event planning and booking apps like Meetup, community forums for women such as Peanut, and ticket booking and management apps like Ticketmaster. Ultimately, we chose to develop an app or website for splitting and tracking bills. This idea received the most votes, as the majority of us identified it as a common problem and believed we could empathize with users to enhance the app's development.

We organized our team by establishing regular meetings, including sprint meetings and stand-up meetings. We convened every day from Monday to Saturday.
