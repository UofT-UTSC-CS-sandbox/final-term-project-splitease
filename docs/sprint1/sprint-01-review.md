## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

* When: June 13,2024
* Where: Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection
During iteraltion 1, we managed to setup the basic pages for our app, including two features.
Our app now features a frontend with six pages, two available features, and comprehensive backend logic.
The group worked togther with jobs assigned and each completed their assigned user stories.


#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Prioritized the development of two key features to provide immediate value and functionality to users, this is important because the product
  is led by the feature implementations, and our ultimate goal is to complete all user stories and features. Prioritizing these features
  can reveal pain points in our development and we can start fixing or optimizing early.
2. Developed a solid backend architecture to support the app's current and future features efficiently.
3. Focused on intuitive UI/UX design, ensuring a user-friendly interface for a better overall experience, we kept our style mostly the same for
  the app UI. First impressions are always important, this also applies to an App/webpage, we want our UI to be simple and graceful.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. The hesitation between making a App or a universal platform (web) delayed the development process of frontend.
2. The orginal choice of using react native was unnecessary and redundant because plan changed from making an APP to making a website.
3. The program language of using react or react native is not decided soon enough, delayed the development of frontend.

#### Planned changes
1. Changed from making an App to a website and reason is making an App is lacking support for multi-platform, while website can provide a universal access.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed

* From most to least important.
* Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
* If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed

* From most to least important.
* For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* 2 - 4 items
* Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
* High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
* These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
* Can be related to product and/or process.
