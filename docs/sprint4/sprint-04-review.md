## Iteration 04 - Review & Retrospect

- When: August 4, 2024

- Where: Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection

During iteration 4, we managed to complete the core functionalities required for our project. We refined our code base and ensured the system's stability by extensively testing and debugging. Our focus was primarily on polishing the webpages for presentation, fixing bugs that arose, and enhancing the user interface for a better user experience. The team worked diligently to resolve any issues and implemented necessary improvements to ensure the project met the desired standards. We also made sure that all the features were well-documented and easy to navigate, paving the way for a smooth and effective final presentation.

Our app now features a frontend with over ten pages, all available features, and comprehensive backend logic matching the frontend.

The group worked together with jobs assigned and each completed their assigned user stories.

#### Decisions that turned out well

1.Prioritizing user interface enhancements, this decision significantly improved the user experience and will make our presentation more engaging.

2. Testing and debugging, this approach ensured a stable and reliable product, minimizing the risk of issues during the presentation and demonstrating our commitment to quality.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Implementing a new feature close to the deadline, this decision led to unforeseen complications and bugs, which consumed valuable time and resources that could have been better spent on polishing existing functionalities and preparing for the presentation.

#### Planned changes

No major planned changes in this iteration.
