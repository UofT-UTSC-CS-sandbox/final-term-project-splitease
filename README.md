## Contributing

### Create a branch

1. `git checkout main` from any folder in your local repository
2. `git pull origin main` to ensure you have the latest main code
3. `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing `the-name-of-my-branch` with a suitable name) to create a branch

### Make the change

1. Follow the ["Running locally"](#running-locally) instructions
1. Save the files and check in the browser
1. Changes to React components in `src` will hot-reload
1. Changes to markdown files in `content` will hot-reload
